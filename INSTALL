Install
   IPP and set IPPROOT shell environment to the root

install
   libX11-devel
   libXau-devel
   ffmpeg-devel
   libXpm
   libXi
   libXmu-devel

call 
  make config
  make


you can set
  IPPROOT - to your local IPP installation
  CUDASTEREO - to your cuda stereo implementation
That's it!!

Windows User (Cygwin) - uncomment the HOST statement in Makefile and Makefile.in

The configure script in the root directory checks for installed hardware
to compile-in different support.

Bt8x8
   NEW: if you use 2.4.x kernel (enable the support in the kernel
   configuration and the default kernel driver will be used).
   You may want to add the following to your /etc/modules.conf
       alias char-major-81 bttv


   The support will only be installed if the correct driver is found
   in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/ or
      /usr/local/share/research/src/bttv/
   the key file verified is the audiochip.h header file.

Firewire
   the Firewire/IEEE1394 support is only included if the
   libraw/raw1394.h is found in the default include path of the used
   compiler. libraw.a is an interface library to the ieee1394 device.
   Install the corresponding package, if you want to use Firewire
   cameras

   Add the following to your /etc/modules.conf

     alias char-major-171 raw1394 
     alias char-major-172 video1394
     pre-install raw1394     modprobe ohci1394

    Install libraw1394-0.9.0.rpm and libdc1394-0.9.0.rpm;
      rm -f /dev/video1394
      mkdir /dev/video1394
      mknod -m 666 /dev/video1394/0 c 171 16

    Depending on the version of libdc1394
      change in src/Devices
        ln -s XVDig1394_v1.cc XVDig1394.cc
	ln -s XVDig1394_v1.h  XVDig1394.h
      or
        ln -s XVDig1394_v2.cc XVDig1394.cc
	ln -s XVDig1394_v2.h  XVDig1394.h
      
 Videre
   it is the interface to the VidereDesign Digital Stereo-Head with
   Firewire connection. The support is compiled, if the environment
   variable SVS_PATH is set to the directory containing libsvs.
   Firewire (see above) needs to be installed as well.
 
 Devices/matlab
   Matlab interfaces (see .m examples) to Firewire cameras
